# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
### Submitted project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository includes source code named "run_analysis.R"
* "run_analysis.R" create tidy dataset called "new_mergedData_meanStd"
* new_mergedData_meanStd is delived from original dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* The explanation of original dataset: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
* New dataset(new_mergedData_meanStd) is created by following instructions
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
Also it includes codebook including descriptions of the variables in new dataset (codebook.md)
